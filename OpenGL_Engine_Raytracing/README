This is a simple shader-based OpenGL program that displays a brief
message.  It accepts keyboard and mouse input; clicking the left mouse
button will switch between two images.  Type 'h' for a list of keyboard
inputs that it will accept.

This program is considerably simpler than the one discussed in my "OpenGL
Programming" lecture notes (16-gl-prog.pdf).  In particular, it does no
object or camera transformations.  The basic structure of the program,
however, is the same.

For compilation on a CS machine, you can use the provided Makefile, or
you can use 'gmakemake > Makefile' to recreate it.

For compilation elsewhere, you'll need to install some support libraries:

    GLEW 2.1.0
    GLFW 3.3.2
    GLM 0.9.9.7 (not needed for this program, but really useful)

See my CSCI-610 "Resources" page for more information.

For compilation on a Mac, you can either set up an XCode project, or just
use the provided 'compmac' shellscript.  Elsewhere, you'll need to figure
out how to get things set up properly.
