# Notice

This project uses my custom "ABCore" library, which is where the code for things like the Transform and Shader classes can be found.

This project uses that library for loading shaders and some other small things, but the main radiosity stuff is happening right here in main.cpp.

If you want to check out ABCore anyway, click this link --> https://github.com/TheOneAbis/OpenGL_Engine/tree/main/ABCore
